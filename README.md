# Sign Language Recognition with Pytorch and MediaPipe

## Introduction 

This project presents an innovative hand sign recognition system using deep learning and computer vision. By leveraging a ResNet34 model - Pytorch combined with MediaPipe and OpenCV, the system accurately detects and interprets hand signs for the alphabet and numbers in real-time. This cutting-edge technology promises to enhance accessibility and revolutionize human-computer interaction, offering new possibilities for communication and control.
